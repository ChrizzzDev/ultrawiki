# ULTRAWIKI

ULTRAWIKI is a fan-made ULTRAKILL wiki site *"dedicated to ULTRAKILL"*, providing detailed information on game levels, enemies, secrets, and other content. It is built with modern web technologies (see Tech Stack below) and aims to create an immersive, interactive experience for users. As a community-driven project, ULTRAWIKI is strictly non-commercial and has no official affiliation with the original ULTRAKILL developers.

## Features

Levels page (finished): Complete listing of all ULTRAKILL levels, with information on challenges, secrets, and level-specific details.

Enemies page (in progress): A categorized list of enemies from the game. Upcoming individual enemy pages will provide stats, behaviors, and lore.

Individual enemy pages (planned): Future pages for each enemy containing in-depth descriptions and images.

Enemies by level: Each level page will list the enemies that appear in that level for easy reference.

Secrets parsing: Secret locations and rewards will be parsed and documented for each level.

P-Rank details: Information on achieving Perfect Rank (P-Rank) scores in each level.

Challenges per level: Details on any special objectives or challenges within each level.

Animated visual effects: The site uses CSS and JS animations (glitch effects, scroll reveal, etc.) to give the UI a dynamic, high-tech feel.

ULTRAWIKI features dynamic animated effects such as glitch-style overlays and reveal-on-scroll transitions. These animations give the site a futuristic, immersive aesthetic that matches the ULTRAKILL theme. The example image above is a placeholder demonstrating the glitchy visual style used in ULTRAWIKI.

## Tech Stack

Tailwind CSS (v4): Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

Skeleton UI (v3): A Svelte/Tailwind component library used for layouts and UI elements.

Kysely (optional): A type-safe SQL query builder (included here for database integration if needed).
